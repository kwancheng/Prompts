# Welcome!

This repo is a collection — and a bit of a journey — through my Japanese tutoring prompts, built to explore the limits of various LLMs. While these generally work across different models, they’re mainly tuned for ChatGPT (which, in my experience, has a bit of a knack for Japanese).

I get most of my guidance from https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text?api-mode=responses

- The `TRS` folder is full of vocabulary drills and experiments.
- `SoraChat` is where the magic happens — it’s currently the most polished and structured set.

Getting started is easy:  
Just open a prompt file, copy and paste it into your chat interface (or drop it into your system prompt box if your UI has one).

**Important:**  
These prompts are initially tailored to my personal learning style. You might need to tweak or guide the model a little bit depending on your own preferences.

# Note to Reviewers

If you're here to get a feel for my prompting skills, I'd recommend starting with
* [**Sora-Airport HND (No Translations) w Tour Guide**](<SoraChat/Sora-Airport HND(No Translations)w Tour Guide.md>) - Role Playing
* [**Word Drills**](SoraChat/TRS/WordDrills3.md) - Game like
* [**Translation Assist**](SoraChat/TRS/TranslateAssist.md) - Utility

It's currently the most complete and deliberate example of my work.

Also, a quick heads-up:  
While I’ve done my best to clean things up, you might stumble across a few "testing the edges" prompts (some lightly NSFW). Thanks in advance for your understanding — pushing limits was part of the experiment!
